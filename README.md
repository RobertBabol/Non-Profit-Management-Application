# Non-Profit-Management-Application

The purpose of this project is to provide management software for a local non-profit club. This software
will allow tracking of important information that is needed to run the club.
This application would be able to:

• Track member information

• Organize who is involved with which fundraising activity

• Keep track of important club information

• Keep track of payments from the members for things like:

• Member dues

•  Payments for events like trips or other activities

•  Donations to the club

• Maintain a calendar with event dates for the club

The software is written in C# and uses MYSQL as the database engine that
can be stored on a web server. This application is designed so that the information stored in the database can be used for
future added features like:

• A mobile application to get information out to the members

• A web version of the application for remote access

To open the program, navigate to Deployment\Files\Program and double-click on NonProfitManagement.exe. The login information is:
